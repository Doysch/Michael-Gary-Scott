So I love the US Office, not as much as the UK, sure, but Michael is a great character who leaves behind a trail of inimitable quotes,
and what better way to celebrate this than have his own soundboard.

This is MY FIRST EVER repo on GitHub that I have shared so I am on a steep learning curve. I'll make many mistakes, but I'm OK with that.

I used Wes Bos's project and simply changed it from a drum kit to Michael Scott's voice and changed the background. So I haven't done much.

There's massive room for improvement - e.g. I'd like to be able to change it so:

1 - the layout of sound buttons i clearer and maybe in 3 rows of 3
2 - change the JS so you can only have one sound playing at a time, but that it can be interruped if you hit another key while one sound is playing. 
3 - change so it's it's responsive to screen sizes

Any other suggestions are more than welcome!
